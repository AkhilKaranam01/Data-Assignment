# Data-Assignment

The data i took from the link is Amazon Reviews.

It contains around 1.2 Million records

The dataset has columns like overall , reveiewText that needs to be analyzed

For analyzing we will use Pyspark in jupyter notebook, We will also use Mysql Workbench for loading the dataframe into a table

## Resources required for the setup.
1. Spark installed in system
2. Jupyter Notebook for writing the code
3. Mysql database and Mysql workbench as a UI to interact

I have explained the code with all the comments in detail in the Jupyter notebook

The most interesting part of the entire dataframe operations is conditional aggregation.
